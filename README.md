Practical exercises i completed while learning SQL coding on SNOWFLAKE
SQL Learning Journey – Andile Dube
This repository documents my SQL learning journey through structured exercises and practicals. Each file contains hands-on queries I wrote and tested, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced data handling.
The goal of this work is to build strong foundations in data analytics and business intelligence, while practicing real-world scenarios using SQL.

🚀 Skills I Have Learned
🟦 Practical 1 – Basic SQL Syntax
• 	Writing  queries to retrieve data
• 	Using  to find unique values
• 	Applying  filters with conditions (, , , )
• 	Aggregations: , , , , 
• 	Grouping data with  and filtering with 
• 	Conditional logic with  (e.g., spending levels, age groups)

🟩 Practical 2 – SQL Joins
• 	INNER JOIN → Combining related data across tables
• 	LEFT JOIN → Including unmatched records from one side
• 	RIGHT JOIN → Ensuring all records from the other side are included
• 	FULL OUTER JOIN → Merging all records, handling NULLs gracefully
• 	Counting and grouping joined data (e.g., product order counts)
• 	Real-world applications: customer orders, product sales, and missing relationships

🟨 Practical 3 – Advanced SQL (Null Functions)
• 	Handling missing values with 
• 	Using  with NULLs for conditional outputs
• 	Grouping and summarizing while treating NULLs as “Unknown”
• 	Cleaning datasets by replacing NULLs in payment methods, shipping types, and review ratings
• 	Advanced filtering with  and conditional aggregations
• 	Practical scenarios: customer purchases, seasonal trends, payment analysis
